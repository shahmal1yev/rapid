# rapid 🚀

A PHP package manager. Written in Go for better cross-platform experience and performance.

## The Idea 💡
The main goal is building a package manager that directly works with GitHub repositories, avoiding the need for a separate package registry platform. Along with this core feature, exploring storage optimizations similar to how pnpm handles packages.

## Current Stage 🌱
This is currently in very early development/proof of concept stage.

## Goals ⭐
- [ ] Use GitHub as primary package registry 📦
- [ ] Implement efficient storage mechanisms 💾
- [ ] Provide simple and intuitive CLI experience ⌨️
- [ ] Make it easy to work with private repositories 🔒

## Why Rapid? 🤔
- **No Package Platform**: Work directly with GitHub repositories
- **Space Efficient**: Smart storage system to save disk space
- **Developer Friendly**: Simple and intuitive commands
- **Modern Approach**: Built with modern PHP development in mind
